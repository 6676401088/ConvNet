<p>
Currently, Cuda ConvNet is not necessarily faster than the one running on the CPU.

This is due to the lack of the breadth in parallelization of the computations.

I anticipate to improve this with better implementation as I learn more about parallel computing,

In the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-parallel-programming--cs344">Udacity Parallel Programming Intro Course</a>.
